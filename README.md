Visualizing retail data via Tableau

This project uses a set of data files from 84.51 (https://www.8451.com/) - a firm which collects and analyzes data from Kroger grocery stores (and all other stores also owned by Kroger). They have data on over 62 million households spanning years. This 'Breakfast at the Frat' contains sales and promotion information on the top five products within four selected categories (mouthwash, pretzels, frozen pizza and boxed cereal) from a sample of stores over 156 weeks.
